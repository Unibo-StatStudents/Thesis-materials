# Zotero guide
## What is Zotero?
Zotero is a **free, open-source** program that helps you organize your literature and cite as you write. 
It is compatible with word and automatically takes over the citing and download of the papers you need. 
No need to worry about citing correctly or messing up your reference numbers anymore!
*Automate your life so that you don't have to be an automate!*

## Install Zotero
Follow the instructions on [this website](https://www.zotero.org/download/). 

## Best practices 
1. Use Collections ('folders') to keep your references organized (for example according to the type of source like example journals, websites or divide your topic into sub-topics with a Collection each).
2. Use **colored** tags to each papers. Personal preferences: I like *Peer-reviewed* (in green) and *read* (with the book emoticon).
3. Download the browser extension so you can directly add sources from the web with just one click! Citing has never been easier. 

## Alternatives
Jabref (especially because of its great latex integration).
