## Template thesis on LaTex

Dear all, 
in this repo you can find a latex template structure which I made where you can write your thesis. 
Remember that it is an **unofficial** implementation and no one is forced to use this template. 

To use it is sufficient to make a copy of the repo and use your favourite LaTex editor.

### Overleaf

To use the template in overleaf you should follow those steps: 
  1. Download the tex and bib files in a Zip file by clicking on the zip file called Statistical_Sciences_template.zip
  2. Select the "Download" button
  3. Log-in on Overleaf
  4. Click on "New project"
  5. Then on "Upload project"
  6. Drag or select the Zip file downloaded
  7. Now you are ready to use and **have fun** with your thesis
